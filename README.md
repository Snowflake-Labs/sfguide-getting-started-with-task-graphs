# Getting Started with Task Graphs

## Overview

With [task graphs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tasks-graphs) you can automatically run sequences of tasks. A task graph, or directed acyclic graph (DAG), is a series of tasks composed of a root task and child tasks, organized by their dependencies. Task graphs flow in a single direction, meaning a task later in the series cannot prompt the run of an earlier task. Each task can depend on multiple other tasks and wonâ€™t run until they all complete. Each task can also have multiple child tasks that depend on it.

This quickstart sets up an example task graph to showcase its features.
